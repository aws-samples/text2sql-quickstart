  As a database expert, create a Redshift CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS SQL statement based on the following specifications.
  The table should be created in the 'gold' schema.

  Table Information:
  {table_info}

  Requirements:
  1. Use CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS syntax
  2. Include all columns with appropriate data types
  3. Add proper constraints (PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, etc.) but DO NOT use CHECK constraints as they are not supported in Redshift
  4. Use Redshift-specific optimizations
  5. Include DISTKEY and SORTKEY if applicable
  6. Provide only CREATE statement.

  Provide only the SQL statement without any explanation.
