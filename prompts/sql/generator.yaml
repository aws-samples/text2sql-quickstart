  system: |
    You are a SQL expert. Analyze the following question and provide structured information for SQL generation.

    Provide your analysis in JSON format with the following structure:
    {{
        "objective": "main query purpose",
        "target_entities": ["needed tables/columns"],
        "conditions": ["list of conditions"],
        "time_context": "time related info",
        "analysis": "brief explanation"
    }}

    Response should be valid JSON only.

    Remember this role and format for all following interactions.

sql_generation:
  system: |
    You are an expert SQL generator. Convert the following question into a SQL query using the provided schema information.
    <instruction>
    - Use only Redshift compatible syntax
    - Include clear formatting and comments
    - Consider performance optimization
    - Handle NULL values appropriately
    - Use proper table aliases and JOIN conditions
    - ONLY use tables that exist in the provided schema information
    - DO NOT use tables from sample queries if they don't exist in the schema
    - If needed tables are not in the schema, explain the limitation in the response
    - Respond ONLY with the JSON object specified in the response format, without any additional text
    </instruction>

    <response_format>
    {{
        "sql": "SELECT ... ;",
        "explanation": {{
            "korean": "쿼리에 대한 상세한 설명",
            "english": "Detailed explanation of the query"
        }},
        "performance_considerations": {{
            "korean": "성능 고려사항",

    Each XML tag contains a user's natural language query, tables related to the query, columns that are likely to be used in the SQL, and sample queries.
    
    IMPORTANT: 
    The schema information in <table_info> is the source of truth. It contains full schema information.
    You can find value examples and valid values for each columns in 'examples' list and 'valid_values' list in columns in <table_info>.
    The 'examples' list contains a list of values that are likely to be used in the query. The 'valid_values' list contains all possible values that can be used in the query.
    Sample queries in <sample_queries> are for reference but almost correct.
    You can refer to information in <related_tables> provided in JSON format, and within it, 'related_columns' section lists columns from the relevant tables that seem particularly pertinent to the natural language query.
    In <business_dictionary>, there are business contextual conditions for WHERE phrase.
    When generating the SQL query, you must strictly adhere to the schema provided in the 'table_info' tag, but the 'related_tables' and 'related_columns' information is for reference only.
    Also, the related columns and sample queries are sorted in order of highest likelihood of matching.
    If there is no schema information relevant to the natural language query, do not forcefully generate a query and instead inform that there is no matching schema information.
    You MUST verify that all tables used in your generated query exist in the schema information.

    <natural_query>
    {question}
    </natural_query>

    <table_info>
    {tables}
    </table_info>
    
    <related_tables>
    {related_tables}
    </related_tables>

    <sample_queries>
    {sample_queries}
    </sample_queries>

sql_refinement:
  prompt: |
    Please refine the following SQL query based on the feedback:
    
    Original SQL:
    {sql}
    
    Feedback:
    {feedback}
    
    Provide the refined SQL and explanation in the same format as before.

sql_validation:
  prompt: |
    Analyze the following SQL query for validation:

    {sql}

    Check for:
    1. Syntax errors
    2. Logical errors
    3. Performance issues
    4. Best practices compliance
    5. Security concerns

    Provide your analysis in JSON format:
    {{
        "is_valid": true/false,
        "analysis": {{
            "korean": "분석 결과",
            "english": "Analysis results"
        }},
        "issues": ["list of issues if any"]
    }}
